		<p>Extinction is the termination of a kind of organism or of a group of kinds (taxon), 
		usually a species. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of 
		the last individual of the species, although the capacity to breed and recover may have
		been lost before this point. Because a species' potential range may be very large, 
		determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This 
		difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct
		abruptly "reappears" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.

More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever 
lived on Earth are estimated to have died out. It's estimated there are currently around 
8.7 million species of eukaryote globally,and possibly many times more if microorganisms, 
like bacteria, are included.

Through evolution, species arise through the process of speciation—where new varieties of
 organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche—and 
 species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or 
 against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches
 has been firmly established. A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of 
 its first appearance, although some species, called living fossils, survive with little to 
 no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years.

Mass extinctions are relatively rare events; however, isolated extinctions are quite common.
 Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the 
 current high rate of extinctions. Most species that become extinct are never scientifically 
 documented. Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal
 species may become extinct by 2100. A 2018 report indicated that the phylogenetic
 diversity of 300 mammalian species erased during the human era since the Late Pleistocene
 would require 5 to 7 million years to recover.

According to the 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services by 
IPBES, the biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%, natural ecosystems have lost about half
 their area and a million species are at risk of extinction—all largely as a result of human
 actions. Twenty-five percent of plant and animal species are threatened with extinction.

In June 2019, one million species of plants and animals were at risk of extinction. At least
 571 species are lost since 1750 but likely many more. The main cause of the extinctions is 
 the destruction of natural habitats by human activities, such as cutting down forests and
 converting land into fields for farming.</p>
