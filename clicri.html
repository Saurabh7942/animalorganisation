		<p>Climate crisis is a term describing global warming and climate change, and their consequences.

The term has been used to describe the threat of global warming to the planet, and to urge aggressive climate 
change mitigation. For example, a January 2020 BioScience article endorsed by over 11,000 scientists worldwide, 
stated that "the climate crisis has arrived" and that an "immense increase of scale in endeavors to conserve our 
biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis."

The term is applied by those who "believe it evokes the gravity of the threats the planet faces from continued
 greenhouse gas emissions and can help spur the kind of political willpower that has long been missing from 
 climate advocacy".They believe that, much as "global warming" drew out more emotional engagement and support 
 for action than "climate change", calling climate change a crisis could have an even stronger impact.

A study has shown that the term does invoke a strong emotional response in conveying a sense of urgency, 
but some caution that this very response may be counter-productive, and may cause a backlash effect due
 to perceptions of alarmist exaggeration.</p>
